# AI-SuperTicTacToe

This is a project that plays a professor's version of SuperTicTacToe against you (or other robots) and should win every time. It is an AI that I built for a course that I took when I was studying abroad in Greece. It went in a tournament against other bots and ultimately I got 2nd place, despite the bug in it at the time. 

**Here is a quick video of me playing against it:** (link here in future)
