# AI-SuperTicTacToe

Written for a final project. Encountering known glitch repetatively, specifically when choosing a space when the entire board is open and the program thinks it can win a board that it doesn't realize is already won. Hope to edit soon, when I have more free time, but I ultimately recived an A on the project. Thanks!
